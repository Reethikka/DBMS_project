Django+MariaDB+Firebase
This is an polling app developed using Django. It uses MariaDB for the database and firebase for the authentication.
This polling app is meant for feedback collection for an other product (country-capital game) which is a game for children under 15 years. This app allows multiple votes to be cast by a parent to emphasize it's weightage. It lets the user remain anonymous from the manufacturer's end and at the same time it also verifies that the user has purchased the product using a password system.
The user can also view the poll results after participating in the poll.
The manufacturer(admin) has the permission to add new questions to the feedback form that gets displayed to the user according to the date the question was posted.
Authentication service is provided by Firebase.
